The main project resides in the threaded branch inside the folder FlamPredict.
To run the project, run the file named "flamline.py". Additionally, for a run, data from LANDFIRE and WindNinja must be curated and the path for the data should be added to the file named "data.py". For a fire other than the 2022 Oak Fire, a different ignition point must also be set.
